### Definitions

#### Abstraction

> The act of representing essential features without including the background detail/explanations. The principle is used to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation

#### Attributes/properties

> .....

#### Class

> A user-defined type or data structure declared with keyword class that has data and functions as its members whose access is governed by the three access specifiers private, protected or public

#### Class Variable

> A class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist

#### Composition

> The process of making one class a data member of another class. Composition is a "has a" relationship

#### Encapsulation

> Encapsulation is a process of combining data members and functions in a single unit called class

#### Friends

> Friend class: A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class
> Friend function: A friend function can be given special grant to access private and protected members (a friend function can be a method of another class or a global function)
> Important note on friend functions and classes: (1) Friendship is not mutual (2) Friendship is not inherited

#### Inheritance

> Allows user to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class(base class). The derived class inherits all the features from the base class and can have additional features of its own

#### Instance Variable

> Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed

#### Member Variable

> In object-oriented programming, a member variable is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods

#### Method

> A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class

#### Multiple Inheritance

> .....

#### Object

> .....

#### Overloading

> .....

#### Polymorphism

> .....

#### Public/Private/Protected

> .....

#### Virtual

> .....
